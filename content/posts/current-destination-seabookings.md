It’s been a while since I have written my last post. I have been a long search for a position where I could learn and enjoy. My search led me to a job search and eventually after attending several interviews, I landed my current job at [SeaBookings](https://www.seabookings.com/) where each of my colleagues have a story to tell. I have been searching for a remote job and after long search and multiple regret messages saying “we can’t hire because of the timezone issues”, “Sorry you don’t have enough experience in the technology we use” and many failed interviews, SeaBookings finally took me in. Hope you get that this post is basically about __SeaBookings__.

First a little about SeaBookings. SeaBookings is a Portuguese based maritime tourism booking site, where anyone can book the best watersports and boat tours experiences with a good customer support service. I’m not exaggerating. Checkout the image below I took from google reviews and the [trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/seabookings.com) reviews attached

I started my journey in SeaBookings in June 2019 after resigning from my previous job in May 2019.
The SeaBookings team members welcomed me with open arms and made me feel that I belonged in a place where I wished I belonged for a long time. I was unfamiliar with Ruby on Rails when I joined SeaBookings. My mentor and CTO of SeaBookings, Mr Fábio guided me through the process by giving me small tasks and lending me all the help I needed. He helped me in clarifying my doubts and step by step he taught me a lot in a short span.

The tasks allotted to me helped me understand rails better and I’m currently working on a feature named Categories which I hope to release as soon as possible. I sincerely hope that my feature helps the customers in some way.

The Founders Ms.Femke, Ms.Bo and my colleagues Ms.Lianne and Ms Nathalie are the soul of SeaBookings where they manage the customer with at most importance and priority. Any customer grievances are taken care with efficiency. They also test our system and give comments and feedback to the development team where we try to sort the issue asap with perfection. They provided me with all the moral support and helped me be a part of the team in short period of time.
## Conclusion
I plan on being in SeaBookings for a long time and be of service to them as much as I can. I feel happy to be part of this team and to work with such passionate and energetic team.

I also feel thankful to be selected as a member of this team and to be working for a service where many customers can have their time of their life with affordable pricing.

I hope that many of you can avail this service to enjoy your time and post and share your experience to your near and dears.
Thanks for reading. Until next time
